          <h2>Shipping and Deliveries</h2>
          <p>
            Virola Threads aims to get most orders dispatched within 7-15
            working days or sooner, subject to customers' specifications, stock,
            and availability of items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that we require a contact number and email address for
            all shipments. If any information is missing, this could lead to
            delays in your order getting to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will contact you via email or phone if there is an unreasonable
            delay or if the items are out of stock.
          </p>
          <p>
            For local deliveries (within Lagos), we aim to deliver within the
            same day after the courier has picked up from our warehouse. This
            also depends on address and communication with the customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            For deliveries within Nigeria but outside Lagos, DHL aims to deliver
            within 1-3 working days picking up from our warehouse. This also
            depends on address and communication with the customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            We ship to all countries via DHL, and it could take between 3-5
            working days for delivery depending on the location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the item delivery destination, some items will be shipped
            on a DDU (Delivery Duties Unpaid) basis, i.e., any duties and taxes
            incurred in the country of destination are the responsibility of the
            customer.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you for any reason refuse delivery, or are unavailable or unable
            to take the delivery despite reasonable attempts by the courier
            company, your item will be returned to Virola Threads, and you will
            be charged for the unpaid duties, taxes, and additional shipping
            costs.
